# Gmail-Sender
A client that sends email from gmail accounts

This program was created using the JavaMail API and the GUI was created using JavaFX and Scene Builder. 

This program is able to send emails from gmail accounts, but the "Less secure app access" setting on the google account *must be turned on*! If this setting is not turned on (it is off by default), then this program will not be allowed to sign in to the gmail account and will be unable to send any emails.
